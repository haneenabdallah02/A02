# Git, WebStorm, and GitHub Step by Step Tutorial

1. Create a GitHub account and install GitHub and **GIT**. Download can be found here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Create a JetBrains account here: https://www.jetbrains.com/
3. Obtain WebStorm license and install WebStorm through JetBrains. License options can be found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/buy/#discounts

5.  Open WebStorm and create a new project
6. Click 'VCS'
7. Click 'Import into Version Control'
8. Click 'Create Git Repository' and select 'OK'
9. In WebStorm, a new **branch** can be created by opening your project and using the git branch command.
10. Make any changes, then **commit** to changes by clicking 'VCS' then click 'Commit'
11. Next, push change by clicking 'VCS' then click 'Git'
12. Next, click '**Push**' to upload your commits and changes to GitHub
13. You can **fetch** remote changes to update your local repository
14. From 'Main,' you can **merge** changes and switch to the desired branch you want to merge into.
15. If **merge conflicts** occur, they can be manually resolved by editing the file
16. To clone a repository, open GitHub and navigate your chosen GitHub repository
17. Click the "Code" button in green and copy the repository's URL
18. Go back to WebStorm and paste the URL in the field requesting the URL for cloning
19. Select the directory location and click '**Clone**'
20. If there are multiple remotes being used, you can add additional **remotes** through Git commands.
